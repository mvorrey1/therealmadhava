## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (or yarn) should be installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd blog-site
   ```

2. Install npm packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the React development server and open the application in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will create a `build` directory with the production-ready files.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in the development mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- `npm test`: Runs the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- `npm run eject`:  **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!** If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
